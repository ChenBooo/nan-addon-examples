# nan-addon-examples
The examples on https://github.com/nodejs/node-addon-examples seems too old. When I complie those file, many error shows up. So I decide to rewrite it use nan@2.7.0

turns out the examples on  https://github.com/nodejs/node-addon-examples are fine. So the project just for practice, to learn git command.

Enviroment:
nan: nan@2.7.0;
node: v6.11.2
os: Linux 4.4.0-93-generic x86_64
